## Design (UXD)

### **Strategy**

The strategy plane looks at what and why we want to build something by asking the following questions.

Is the content culturally appropriate?  
  - *Yes. Content is targeted to fans of the fictional gamer.*

Is the content relevant?  
  - *Yes. Content is game based and about the fictional gamer.*

Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way?  
  - *Yes. The site contains links with easy to understand text and images.*

Is the technology appropriate?  
  - *Yes. The website contains game content that you would expect from a gaming website.*

### **Scope**

The Scope plane defines the wants and needs of the user by asking the following questions.

What does the user want to accomplish?  
  - *Watch/learn about their favourite fictional gamer*

What does the user need to do in order to achieve their objective?  
  - *Navigate around the website, click on links and imagery.*

What constraints does the site have to conform within?  
  - *To be built with HTML and CSS.*

What dynamic constraints do we have to meet?  
  - *Make sure itâ€™s game appropriate content.*

### **Structure and Skeleton**

A rough wireframe blueprint of the website was created showing an interpretation of all three platforms and showcasing its responsive design.

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq. [View wireframes here.](https://github.com/SteveBesgrove/MileStoneProject-TheGamer/blob/main/assets/images/THEGAMER%20wireframes.png?raw=true)

### **Surface (the design)**

I wanted to make a fun and visually attractive website allowing usability for all.

**Colour Palette**  
I decided you use darker background colours with white-out type for the easiest viewability.

**Typography**  
All fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/).  
I decided to use Open Sans for all of my copy, as it's an easy to read font with plenty of weights.

**Imagery**  
The images and video clips have been sourced from the [Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/) and the relevant games.  
The gaming man image was creating using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F).

**Iconography**  
Icons have been sourced from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
